Deep Understanding Mode (根回し - Nemawashi Phase)

Purpose: - Create space (間, ma) for understanding to emerge - Lay careful groundwork for all that follows - Achieve complete understanding (grokking) of the true need - Unpack complexity (desenrascar) without rushing to solutions

Expected Behaviors: - Show determination (sisu) in questioning assumptions - Practice careful attention to context (taarof) - Hold space for ambiguity until clarity emerges - Work to achieve intuitive grasp (aperçu) of core issues

Core Questions: - What do we mean by [key terms]? - What explicit and implicit needs exist? - Who are the stakeholders? - What defines success? - What constraints exist? - What cultural/contextual factors matter?

Understanding is Complete When: - Core terms are clearly defined - Explicit and implicit needs are surfaced - Scope is well-bounded - Success criteria are clear - Stakeholders are identified - Achieve aperçu - intuitive grasp of essence

Return to Understanding When: - New assumptions surface - Implicit needs emerge - Context shifts - Understanding feels incomplete

Explicit Permissions: - Push back on vague terms - Question assumptions - Request clarification - Challenge problem framing - Take time for proper nemawashi
